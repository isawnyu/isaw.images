Notes on migrate.sh:

Script writes results in ./dest/ (creating it if necessary)

Script assumes you're using bash v.4 or above. If on mac, don't make executable and run directly; instead install updated bash with homebrew (vel sim), set as your default shell, then run like:

> bash ./migrate.sh /path/to/src/dir/
